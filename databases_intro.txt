  As databases store data in a binary file format that is intelligible by humans, you would use a text file whenever your data needs to be read by humans.  Databases should be utilized when storing large amounts of data that will be frequently modified.

 A difference between SQL and other programming languages is that SQL is declarative instead of procedural.  SQL does not rely on an explicit set of instructions for how something must be done, just what actually needs to be done.

4.
 Databases use a table structure to hold data.  Data is held in individual cells; the cells form horizontal rows and vertical columns.  Columns should be the same type of data; each row is an individual unit.  A budget spreadsheet is the easiest way to visualize this - each row would represent a particular expense; one column should contain strings of WHAT the expense is, another float for the amount of the expense.

 Table - collection of data made up of rows and columns that are made up of cells.
 Row - a complete conceptual unit made up of cells

 Value - data held within cells.

 Tables can be made up of a number of data types, including strings, integers, and date.
